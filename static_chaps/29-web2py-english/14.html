<h2>Other recipes</h2><h3>Upgrading</h3><div class="inxx">upgrades</div><p>In the "site" page of the administrative interface there is an "upgrade now" button. In case this is not feasible or does not work (for example because of a file locking issue), upgrading web2py manually is very easy.</p><blockquote>Simply unzip the latest version of web2py over the old installation.</blockquote><p>This will upgrade all the libraries as well as the applications <strong>admin</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>welcome</strong>. It will also create a new empty file "NEWINSTALL". Upon restarting, web2py will delete the empty file and package the welcome app into "welcome.w2p" that will be used as the new scaffolding app.</p><p>web2py does not upgrade any file in your applications. Some important parts of the framework are not part of the libraries, but part of the Welcome app. New apps will inherit these framework changes, but not existing apps. You need to do copy or merge changes manually. Sometimes this is necessary to take advantage of new functionality, and sometimes it is necessary for compatibility with new releases, particularly if you are using experimental features. The web2py group at Google Groups is a good way to keep track of necessary changes. Parts of the welcome app to copy to existing apps are the appadmin controller, the top-level views including appadmin.html and the generic views, and the contents of the static folder which contains the latest version of important javascript files. Obviously you need to merge your changes (if any). Keeping backups or using a version control system is a sound idea.</p><h3>How to distribute your applications as binaries</h3><p>It is possible to bundle your app with the web2py binary distribution and distribute them together. The license allows this as long you make clear in the license of your app that you are bundling with web2py and add a link to the <code>web2py.com</code>.</p><p>Here we explain how to do it for Windows:</p><ul><li>Create your app as usual</li><li>Using <strong>admin</strong>, bytecode compile your app (one click)</li><li>Using <strong>admin</strong>, pack your app compiled (another click)</li><li>Create a folder "myapp"</li><li>Download a web2py windows binary distribution</li><li>Unzip it in folder "myapp" and start it (two clicks)</li><li>Upload using <strong>admin</strong> the previously packed and compiled app with the name "init" (one click)</li><li>Create a file "myapp/start.bat" that contains "web2py/web2py.exe"</li><li>Create a file "myapp/license" that contains a license for your app and make sure it states that it is being "distributed with an unmodified copy of web2py from web2py.com"</li><li>Zip the myapp folder into a file "myapp.zip"</li><li>Distribute and/or sell "myapp.zip"</li></ul><p>When users will unzip "myapp.zip" and click "run" they will see your app instead of the "welcome" app. There is no requirement on the user side, not even Python pre-installed.</p><p>For Mac binaries the process is the same but there is no need for the "bat" file.</p><h3>Developing with IDEs: WingIDE, Rad2Py, Eclipse and PyCharm</h3><p><div class="inxx">WingIDE</div> <div class="inxx">Eclipse</div> <div class="inxx">Rad2Py</div></p><p>You can use web2py with third party IDEs such as WingIDE, Rad2Py, Eclipse and PyCharm.</p><h4>PyCharm</h4><div class="inxx">PyCharm</div><p>PyCharm v3 Professional Edition introduces built-in support for web2py.</p><p>As of v3.0, PyCharm will recognise web2py applications belong to a web2py parent directory, and this will activate the web2py support. Support means that the web2py library is added to the project.</p><p>Start a PyCharm project by opening the directory of the web2py installation, and then navigate through the applications directory.</p><p>PyCharm's git integration copes with this; it supports multiple git repositories inside the one project directory structure. Keep each application in its own git repository for easy deployment.</p><p>The Professional edition includes a default launcher for a web2py project starts web2py.py and therefore launches the integrated rocket server.</p><h5>PyCharm Debugging tips</h5><p>You can drop into PyCharm's debugger like any other Python session. This means that you can start debugging the script web2py.py, which will run the rocket server, with PyCharm connected to this process. Use your browser to activate the controller function you are interested it.</p><p>When a breakpoint is encountered during the request, you will arrive in PyCharm's debugger.</p><p>However, this requires removal of <code>from gluon.debug import dbg</code> statements.</p><h5>Pycharm: Debugging a module in web2py's context</h5><p>It can be convenient to directly debug a module with test code in isolation from the rest of web2py. You can make a standard PyCharm run/debug configuration to run a module file as a stand-alone python script and put your testing code in</p><code class="code">if __name__ == "__main__":</code><p>but then you don't get web2py's models and database connections.</p><p>You can make dummy controllers and breakpoint into your module after running the dummy controller function via your browser, as described above, but there is a more convenient option:</p><p>Imagine you have this testing block in a module <code>module_1.py</code>:</p><pre><code class="code">if __name__ == "__main__":
    ... code which tests things</code></pre><p>and at the same time, you want the database connections and models to be available the same as web2py does normally.</p><p>Using web2py command line options, you can make a PyCharm run/debug configuration do this. Make the script: <code>web2py.py</code> Make the script parameters: <code>-S &lt;your_app_name&gt; -M -R /path/to/your_module/module_1.py</code>`:code</p><p>This will run the web2py models, and then load your module, which will then run the <code>__main__</code> code in a context similar to a running web2py app. These command line options are documented in chapter 4.</p><h4>WingIDE</h4><p>Here is a screenshot of using web2py with WingIDE:</p><p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/web2py_book/default/image/29/wingide.png" alt="image" style="width:480px" /></p></p><h4>Using general purpose IDEs with web2py</h4><p>The general problem with these IDEs (except those which support web2py) is that they do not understand the context in which models and controllers are executed and therefore autocompletion does not work out of the box.</p><p>To make autocompletion work the general trick consists in editing your models and controllers and adding the following code:</p><pre><code class="code">if False:
    from gluon import *
    request = current.request
    response = current.response
    session = current.session
    cache = current.cache
    T = current.T</code></pre><p>The import block does not change the logic as this is never executed but it forces the IDE to parse it and understand where the objects in the global namespace come from (the <code>gluon</code> module) thus making autocompletion work.</p><p>If you are relying on variables in your models (such as database definitions) you may consider adding to the list like this:</p><pre><code class="code">   from db import *</code></pre><p>You can also consider importing all models.</p><pre><code class="code">if False:  
    from gluon import *
    from db import *  #repeat for all models
    from menu import *</code></pre><p>As well, if using Eclipse with PyDev you should add the web2py folder to the system python path (in PyDev preferences for the python interpreter). In some versions of PyDev, it has been possible to use the debugging support inside Eclipse by launching web2py.py. It is probably wise to remove the import of the gluon debug module. Also, to do this you should make the pydev project the web2py directory, not your specific application.</p><p>PyDev's git integration copes with this; it supports multiple git repositories inside the one project directory structure.</p><h3>SQLDesigner</h3><p>There is a software called SQLDesigner which allows you to build web2py models visually and then generate the corresponding code. Here is a screenshot.</p><p><p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/web2py_book/default/image/29/designer.png" alt="image" style="width:480px" /></p></p><p>The version of SQLDesigner which works with web2py can be found here:</p><code>https://github.com/elcio/visualdal</code><h3>Publishing a folder</h3><p>Consider the problem of sharing a folder (and subfolders) on the web. web2py makes this very easy. You just need a controller like this:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.tools import Expose
def myfolder():
    return dict(files=Expose('/path/to/myfolder'))</code></pre><p>which you can render in a view with <code>{{=files}}</code>. It will create an interface to view the files and folders, and navigate the tree structure. Images will have a preview.</p><p>The path prefix "/path/to/myfolder" will be hidden to the visitors. For example a file called "/path/to/myfolder/a/b.txt" will be replaced with "base/a/b.txt". The "base" prefix can be specified using the <code>basename</code> argument of the Expose function. Using the argument <code>extensions</code> can specify a list of file extensions to be listed, other files will be hidden. For example:</p><pre><code class="code">def myfolder():
    return dict(files=Expose('/path/to/myfolder',basename='.',
                             extensions=['.py', '.jpg']))</code></pre><p>Files and folders that contain the word "private" in the path or have file that start with "." or terminate in "~" are always hidden.</p><h3>Functional testing</h3><p>web2py comes with a module <code>gluon.contrib.webclient</code> which allows functional testing of local and remote web2py applications. Actually, this module is not web2py specific and it can be used for testing and interacting programmatically with any web application, yet it is designed to understand web2py session and web2py postbacks.</p><p>Here is an example of usage. The program below creates a client, connects to the "index" action in order to establish a session, registers a new user, then logouts, and logins again using the newly created credentials:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.contrib.webclient import WebClient

client = WebClient('http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome/default/',
                   postbacks=True)

client.get('index')
# register
data = dict(first_name='Homer',
            last_name='Simpson',
            email='homer@web2py.com',
            password='test',
            password_two='test',
            _formname='register')
client.post('user/register', data=data)

# logout
client.get('user/logout')

# login again
data = dict(email='homer@web2py.com',
            password='test',
            _formname='login')
client.post('user/login', data=data)

# check registration and login were successful
client.get('index')
assert('Welcome Homer' in client.text)</code></pre><p>The WebClient constructor takes a URL prefix as argument. In the example that is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome/default/". It does not perform any network IO. The <code>postbacks</code> argument defaults to <code>True</code> and tells the client how to handle web2py postbacks.</p><p>The WebClient object, <code>client</code>, has only two methods: <code>get</code> and <code>post</code>.  The first argument is always a URL postfix. The full URL for the GET of POST request is constructed simply by concatenating the prefix and the postfix. The purpose of this is imply making the syntax less verbose for long conversations between client and server.</p><p><code>data</code> is a parameter specific of POST request and contains a dictionary of the data to be posted. Web2py forms have a hidden <code>_formname</code> field and its value must be provided unless there is a single form in the page. Web2py forms also contain a hidden <code>_formkey</code> field which is designed to prevent CSRF attacked. It is handled automatically by WebClient.</p><p>Both <code>client.get</code> and <code>client.post</code> accept the following extra arguments:</p><ul><li><code>headers</code>: a dictionary of optional HTTP headers.</li><li><code>cookies</code>: a dictionary of optional HTTP cookies.</li><li><code>auth</code>: a dictionary of parameters to be passed to <code>urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler().add_password(**auth)</code> in order to perform basic authentication. For more information about this we refer to the Python documentation for the urllib2 module.</li></ul><p>The <code>client</code> object in the example carries on a conversation with the server specified in the constructor by making GET and POST requests. It automatically handles all cookies and sends them back to maintain sessions. If it detects that a new session cookie is issued while an existing one is already present, it interprets it as a broken session and raises an exception. If the server returns an HTTP error, it raises an exception. If the server returns an HTTP error which contains a web2py ticket, it returns a RuntimeError exception containing the ticket code.</p><p>The <code>client</code> object maintains a log of requests in <code>client.history</code> and a state associated with its last successful request. The state consists of:</p><ul><li><code>client.status</code>: the returned status code</li><li><code>client.text</code>: the content of the page</li><li><code>client.headers</code>: a dictionary of parsed headers</li><li><code>client.cookies</code>: a dictionary of parsed cookies</li><li><code>client.sessions</code>: a dictionary of web2py sessions in the form <code>{appname: session_id}</code>.</li><li><code>client.forms</code>: a dictionary of web2py forms detected in the <code>client.text</code>. The dictionary has the form <code>{_formname,_formkey}</code>.</li></ul><p>The WebClient object does not perform any parsing of the <code>client.text</code> returned by the server but this can easily be accomplished with many third-party modules such as BeautifulSoup. For example here is an example code that finds all links in a page downloaded by the client and checks all of them:</p><pre><code>from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
dom = BeautifulSoup(client.text)
for link in dom.findAll('a'):
    new_client = WebClient()
    new_client.get(a.href)
    print new_client.status</code></pre><h3>Building a minimalist web2py</h3><p>Some times we need to deploy web2py in a server with very small memory footprint. In this case we want to strip down web2py to its bare minimum.</p><p>An easy way to do it is the following:</p><ul><li>On a production machine, install the full web2py from source</li><li>From inside the main web2py folder run</li></ul><pre><code>python scripts/make_min_web2py.py /path/to/minweb2py</code></pre><ul><li>Now copy under "/path/to/minweb2py/applications" the applications you want to deploy</li><li>Deploy "/path/to/minweb2py" to the small footprint server</li></ul><p>The script "make_min_web2py.py" builds a minimalist web2py distribution that does not include:</p><ul><li>admin</li><li>examples</li><li>welcome</li><li>scripts</li><li>rarely used contrib modules</li></ul><p>It does include a "welcome" app consisting of a single file to allow testing deployment. Look into this script. At the top it contains a detailed list of what is included and what is ignored. You can easily modify it and tailor to your needs.</p><h3>Fetching an external URL</h3><div class="inxx">fetch</div><p>Python includes the <code>urllib</code> library for fetching urls:</p><pre><code class="code">import urllib
page = urllib.urlopen('http://www.web2py.com').read()</code></pre><div class="inxx">API</div><p>This is often fine, but the <code>urllib</code> module does not work on the Google App Engine. Google provides a different API for downloading URLs that works on GAE only. In order to make your code portable, web2py includes a <code>fetch</code> function that works on GAE as well as other Python installations:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.tools import fetch
page = fetch('http://www.web2py.com')</code></pre><h3>Pretty dates</h3><div class="inxx">prettydate</div><p>It is often useful to represent a datetime not as "2009-07-25 14:34:56" but as "one year ago". web2py provides a utility function for this:</p><pre><code class="code">import datetime
d = datetime.datetime(2009,7,25,14,34,56)
from gluon.tools import prettydate
pretty_d = prettydate(d,T)</code></pre><p>The second argument (T) must be passed to allow internationalization for the output.</p><h3>Geocoding</h3><div class="inxx">geocode</div><p>If you need to convert an address (for example: "243 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL, USA") into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), web2py provides a function to do so.</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.tools import geocode
address = '243 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL, USA'
(latitude, longitude) = geocode(address)</code></pre><p>The function <code>geocode</code> requires a network connection and it connects to the Google geocoding service for the geocoding. The function returns <code>(0,0)</code> in case of failure. Notice that the Google geocoding service caps the number of requests, so you should check their service agreement. The <code>geocode</code> function is built on top of the <code>fetch</code> function and thus it works on GAE.</p><h3>Pagination</h3><div class="inxx">pagination</div><p>This recipe is a useful trick to minimize database access in case of pagination, e.g., when you need to display a list of rows from a database but you want to distribute the rows over multiple pages.</p><p>Start by creating a <strong>primes</strong> application that stores the first 1000 prime numbers in a database.</p><p>Here is the model <code>db.py</code>:</p><pre><code class="code">db = DAL('sqlite://primes.db')
db.define_table('prime',Field('value','integer'))
def isprime(p):
    for i in range(2,p):
        if p%i==0: return False
    return True
if len(db().select(db.prime.id))==0:
   p=2
   for i in range(1000):
       while not isprime(p): p+=1
       db.prime.insert(value=p)
       p+=1</code></pre><p>Now create an action <code>list_items</code> in the "default.py" controller that reads like this:</p><pre><code class="code">def list_items():
    if len(request.args): page=int(request.args[0])
    else: page=0
    items_per_page=20
    limitby=(page*items_per_page,(page+1)*items_per_page+1)
    rows=db().select(db.prime.ALL,limitby=limitby)
    return dict(rows=rows,page=page,items_per_page=items_per_page)</code></pre><p>Notice that this code selects one more item than is needed, 20+1. The extra element tells the view whether there is a next page.</p><p>Here is the "default/list_items.html" view:</p><pre><code class="code">{{extend 'layout.html'}}

{{for i,row in enumerate(rows):}}
{{if i==items_per_page: break}}
{{=row.value}}&lt;br /&gt;
{{pass}}

{{if page:}}
&lt;a href="{{=URL(args=[page-1])}}"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt;
{{pass}}

{{if len(rows)&gt;items_per_page:}}
&lt;a href="{{=URL(args=[page+1])}}"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt;
{{pass}}</code></pre><p>In this way we have obtained pagination with one single select per action, and that one select only selects one row more than we need.</p><h3>httpserver.log and the Log File Format</h3><div class="inxx">httpserver.log</div><p>The web2py web server logs all requests to a file called:</p><pre><code class="code">httpserver.log</code></pre><p>in the root web2py directory. An alternative filename and location can be specified via web2py command-line options.</p><p>New entries are appended to the end of the file each time a request is made. Each line looks like this:</p><pre><code class="code">127.0.0.1, 2008-01-12 10:41:20, GET, /admin/default/site, HTTP/1.1, 200, 0.270000</code></pre><p>The format is:</p><pre><code class="code">ip, timestamp, method, path, protocol, status, time_taken</code></pre><p>Where</p><ul><li>ip is the IP address of the client who made the request</li><li>timestamp is the date and time of the request in ISO 8601 format, YYYY-MM-DDT HH:MM:SS</li><li>method is either GET or POST</li><li>path is the path requested by the client</li><li>protocol is the HTTP protocol used to send to the client, usually HTTP/1.1</li><li>status is the one of the HTTP status codes <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/status" target="_blank">status</a>]</sup></li><li>time_taken is the amount of time the server took to process the request, in seconds, not including upload/download time.</li></ul><p>In the appliances repository <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/appliances" target="_blank">appliances</a>]</sup> , you will find an appliance for log analysis.</p><p>This logging is disabled by default when using mod_wsgi since it would be the same as the Apache log.</p><h3>Populating database with dummy data</h3><p>For testing purposes, it is convenient to be able to populate database tables with dummy data. web2py includes a Bayesian classifier already trained to generate dummy but readable text for this purpose.</p><p>Here is the simplest way to use it:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.contrib.populate import populate
populate(db.mytable,100)</code></pre><p>It will insert 100 dummy records into db.mytable. It will try to do intelligently by generating short text for string fields, longer text for text fields, integers, doubles, dates, datetimes, times, booleans, etc. for the corresponding fields. It will try to respect requirements imposed by validators. For fields containing the word "name" it will try to generate dummy names. For reference fields it will generate valid references.</p><p>If you have two tables (A and B) where B references A, make sure to populate A first and B second.</p><p>Because population is done in a transaction, do not attempt to populate too many records at once, particularly if references are involved. Instead, populate 100 at a time, commit, loop.</p><pre><code class="code">for i in range(10):
    populate(db.mytable,100)
    db.commit()</code></pre><p>You can use the Bayesian classifier to learn some text and generate dummy text that sounds similar but should not make sense:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.contrib.populate import Learner, IUP
ell=Learner()
ell.learn('some very long input text ...')
print ell.generate(1000,prefix=None)</code></pre><h3>Accepting credit card payments</h3><p><div class="inxx">Google Wallet</div> <div class="inxx">Paypal</div> <div class="inxx">Stripe.com</div> <div class="inxx">Authorize.net</div> <div class="inxx">DowCommerce</div></p><p>There are multiple ways to accept credit card payments online. web2py provides specific APIs for some of the most popular and practical ones:</p><ul><li>Google Wallet <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/googlewallet" target="_blank">googlewallet</a>]</sup></li><li>PayPal <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/paypal" target="_blank">paypal</a>]</sup></li><li>Stripe.com <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/stripe" target="_blank">stripe</a>]</sup></li><li>Authorize.net <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/authorizenet" target="_blank">authorizenet</a>]</sup></li><li>DowCommerece <sup>[<a href="/web2py_book/default/reference/29/dowcommerce" target="_blank">dowcommerce</a>]</sup></li></ul><p>The first two mechanisms above delegate the process of authenticating the payee to an external service. While this is the best solution for security (your app does not handle any credit card information at all) it makes the process cumbersome (the user must login twice; for example, once with your app, and once with Google) and does not allow your app to handle recurrent payments in an automated way.</p><p>There are times when you need more control and you want to generate yourself the entry form for the credit card info and than programmatically ask the processor to transfer money from the credit card to your account.</p><p>For this reason web2py provide integration out of the box with Stripe, Authorize.net (the module was developed by John Conde and slightly modified) and DowCommerce. Stripe is the simplest to use and also the cheapest for low volume of transactions (they charge no fix cost but charge about 3% per transaction). Authorize.net is better for high volumes (has a fixed yearly costs plus a lower cost per transaction).</p><p>Mind that in the case of Stripe and Authorize.net your program will be accepting credit cards information. You do not have to store this information and we advise you not to because of the legal requirements involved (check with Visa or MasterCard), but there are times when you may want to store the information for recurrent payments or to reproduce the Amazon one-click pay button.</p><h4>Google Wallet</h4><p>The simplest way to use Google Wallet (Level 1) consists of embedding a button on your page that, when clicked, redirects your visitor to a payment page provided by Google.</p><p>First of all you need to register a Google Merchant Account at the url:</p><pre><code>https://checkout.google.com/sell</code></pre><p>You will need to provide Google with your bank information. Google will assign you a <code>merchant_id</code> and a <code>merchant_key</code> (do not confuse them, keep them secret).</p><p>Then you simply need to create the following code in your view:</p><pre><code>{{from gluon.contrib.google_wallet import button}}
{{=button(merchant_id="123456789012345",
           products=[dict(name="shoes",
                          quantity=1,
                          price=23.5,
                          currency='USD',
                          description="running shoes black")])}}</code></pre><p>When a visitor clicks on the button, the visitor will be redirected to the Google page where he/she can pay for the items. Here products is a list of products and each product is a dictionary of parameters that you want to pass describing your items (name, quantity, price, currency, description, and other optional ones which you can find described in the Google Wallet documentation).</p><p>If you choose to use this mechanism, you may want to generate the values passed to the button programmatically based on your inventory and the visitor shopping chart.</p><p>All the tax and shipping information will be handled on the Google side. Same for accounting information. By default your application is not notified that the transaction has been completed therefore you will have to visit your Google Merchant site to see which products have been purchased and paid for, and which products you need to ship to your buyers there. Google will also send you an email with the information.</p><p>If you want a tighter integration, you have to use the Level 2 notification API. In that case you can pass more information to Google and Google will call your API to notify about purchases. This allows you to keep accounting information within your application but it requires you expose web services that can talk to Google Wallet.</p><p>This is a considerable more difficult problem but such API has already been implemented and it is available as plugin from</p><pre><code>http://web2py.com/plugins/static/web2py.plugin.google_checkout.w2p</code></pre><p>You can find the documentation of the plugin in the plugin itself.</p><h4>Paypal</h4><p>Paypal integration is not described here but you can find more information about it at this resource:</p><pre><code>http://www.web2pyslices.com/main/slices/take_slice/9</code></pre><h4>Stripe.com</h4><p>This is probably one of the easiest way and flexible ways to accept credit card payments.</p><p>You need to register with Stripe.com and that is a very easy process, in fact Stripe will assign you an API key to try even before you create any credentials.</p><p>Once you have the API key you can accept credit cards with the following code:</p><pre><code>from gluon.contrib.stripe import Stripe
stripe = Stripe(api_key)
d = stripe.charge(amount=100,
              currency='usd',
              card_number='4242424242424242',
              card_exp_month='5',
              card_exp_year='2012',
              card_cvc_check='123',
              description='the usual black shoes')
if d.get('paid',False):
    # payment accepted
elif:
    # error is in d.get('error','unknown')</code></pre><p>The response, <code>d</code>, is a dictionary which you can explore yourself. The card number used in the example is a sandbox and it will always succeed. Each transaction is associated to a transaction id stored in <code>d['id']</code>.</p><p>Stripe also allows you to verify a transaction at a later time:</p><pre><code>d = Stripe(key).check(d['id'])</code></pre><p>and refund a transaction:</p><pre><code>r = Stripe(key).refund(d['id'])
if r.get('refunded',False):
    # refund was successful
elif:
    # error is in d.get('error','unknown')</code></pre><p>Stripe makes very easy to keep the accounting within your application.</p><p>All the communications between your app and Stripe go over RESTful web services. Stripe actually exposes even more services and provides a larger set of Python API.

As usual you need to register and you will obtain a <code>login</code> and a transaction key (<code>transkey</code>. Once you have them it works very much like Stripe does:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.contrib.AuthorizeNet import process
if process(creditcard='4427802641004797',
           expiration="122012",
           total=100.0,cvv='123',tax=None,invoice=None,
           login='cnpdev4289', transkey='SR2P8g4jdEn7vFLQ',testmode=True):
   # payment was processed
else:
   # payment was rejected</code></pre><p>If you have a valid Authorize.Net account you should replace the sandbox <code>login</code> and <code>transkey</code> with those of your account, set <code>testmode=False</code> to run on the real platform instead of the sandbox, and use credit card information provided by the visitor.</p><p>If <code>process</code> returns <code>True</code>, the money has been transferred from the visitor credit card account to your Authorize.Net account. <code>invoice</code> is just a string that you can set and will be store by Authorize.Net with this transaction so that you can reconcile the data with the information in your application.</p><p>Here is a more complex example of workflow where more variables are exposed:</p><pre><code class="code">from gluon.contrib.AuthorizeNet import AIM
payment = AIM(login='cnpdev4289',
              transkey='SR2P8g4jdEn7vFLQ',
              testmod=True)
payment.setTransaction(creditcard, expiration, total, cvv, tax, invoice)
payment.setParameter('x_duplicate_window', 180) # three minutes duplicate windows
payment.setParameter('x_cust_id', '1324')       # customer ID
payment.setParameter('x_first_name', 'Agent')
payment.setParameter('x_last_name', 'Smith')
payment.setParameter('x_company', 'Test Company')
payment.setParameter('x_address', '1234 Main Street')
payment.setParameter('x_city', 'Townsville')
payment.setParameter('x_state', 'NJ')
payment.setParameter('x_zip', '12345')
payment.setParameter('x_country', 'US')
payment.setParameter('x_phone', '800-555-1234')
payment.setParameter('x_description', 'Test Transaction')
payment.setParameter('x_customer_ip', socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()))
payment.setParameter('x_email', 'you@example.com')
payment.setParameter('x_email_customer', False)

payment.process()
if payment.isApproved():
    print 'Response Code: ', payment.response.ResponseCode
    print 'Response Text: ', payment.response.ResponseText
    print 'Response: ', payment.getResultResponseFull()
    print 'Transaction ID: ', payment.response.TransactionID
    print 'CVV Result: ', payment.response.CVVResponse
    print 'Approval Code: ', payment.response.AuthCode
    print 'AVS Result: ', payment.response.AVSResponse
elif payment.isDeclined():
    print 'Your credit card was declined by your bank'
elif payment.isError():
    print 'It did not work'
print 'approved',payment.isApproved()
print 'declined',payment.isDeclined()
print 'error',payment.isError()</code></pre><p>Notice the code above uses a dummy test account. You need to register with Authorize.Net (it is not a free service) and provide your own login, transkey, testmode=True or False to the AIM constructor.</p><h3>Dropbox API</h3><div class="inxx">Dropbox.com</div><p>Dropbox is a very popular storage service. It not only stores your files but it keeps the cloud storage in sync with all your machines. It allows you to create groups and give read/write permissions to the various folders to individual users or groups. It also keeps version history of all your files. It includes a folder called "Public" and each file you put in there will have its own public URL. Dropbox is a great way to collaborate.</p><p>You can access dropbox easily by registering at</p><pre><code>https://www.dropbox.com/developers</code></pre><p>you will get an <code>APP_KEY</code> and an <code>APP_SECRET</code>. Once you have them you can use Dropbox to authenticate your users.</p><p>Create a file called "yourapp/private/dropbox.key" and in it write</p><pre><code>&lt;APP_KEY&gt;:&lt;APP_SECRET&gt;:app_folder</code></pre><p>where <code>&lt;APP_KEY&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;APP_SECRET&gt;</code> are your key and secret. The third part could be <code>app_folder</code> or <code>dropbox</code> or <code>auto</code>.</p><p>Install the dropbox sdk from "https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdks/python".</p><p>Then in "models/db.py" do:</p><pre><code>from gluon.contrib.login_methods.dropbox_account import use_dropbox
use_janrain(auth,filename='private/dropbox.key')
mydropbox = auth.settings.login_form</code></pre><p>This will allow users to login into your app using their dropbox credentials, and your program will be able to upload files into their dropbox account:</p><pre><code>stream = open('localfile.txt','rb')
mydropbox.put('destfile.txt',stream)</code></pre><p>download files:</p><pre><code>stream = mydropbox.get('destfile.txt')
open('localfile.txt','wb').write(read)</code></pre><p>and get directory listings:</p><pre><code>contents = mydropbox.dir(path = '/')['contents']</code></pre><h3>Twitter API</h3><p>Here are some quick examples on how to post/get tweets. No third-party libraries are required, since Twitter uses simple RESTful APIs.</p><p>Here is an example of how to post a tweet:</p><pre><code class="code">def post_tweet(username,password,message):
    import urllib, urllib2, base64
    import gluon.contrib.simplejson as sj
    args= urllib.urlencode([('status',message)])
    headers={}
    headers['Authorization'] = 'Basic '+base64.b64encode(
        username+':'+password)
    req = urllib2.Request(
        'http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json',
        args, headers)
    return  sj.loads(urllib2.urlopen(req).read())</code></pre><p>Here is an example of how to receive tweets:</p><pre><code class="code">def get_tweets():
    user='web2py'
    import urllib
    import gluon.contrib.simplejson as sj
    page = urllib.urlopen('http://twitter.com/%s?format=json' % user).read()
    tweets=XML(sj.loads(page)['#timeline'])
    return dict(tweets=tweets)</code></pre><p>For more complex operations, refer to the Twitter API documentation.</p><h3>Streaming virtual files</h3><div class="inxx">streaming</div><p>It is common for malicious attackers to scan web sites for vulnerabilities. They use security scanners like Nessus to explore the target web sites for scripts that are known to have vulnerabilities. An analysis of web server logs from a scanned machine or directly in the Nessus database reveals that most of the known vulnerabilities are in PHP scripts and ASP scripts. Since we are running web2py, we do not have those vulnerabilities, but we will still be scanned for them. This is annoying, so we like to respond to those vulnerability scans and make the attacker understand their time is being wasted.</p><p>One possibility is to redirect all requests for .php, .asp, and anything suspicious to a dummy action that will respond to the attack by keeping the attacker busy for a large amount of time. Eventually the attacker will give up and will not scan us again.</p><p>This recipe requires two parts.</p><p>A dedicated application called <strong>jammer</strong> with a "default.py" controller as follows:</p><pre><code class="code">class Jammer():
   def read(self,n): return 'x'*n
def jam(): return response.stream(Jammer(),40000)</code></pre><p>When this action is called, it responds with an infinite data stream full of "x"-es. 40000 characters at a time.</p><p>The second ingredient is a "route.py" file that redirects any request ending in .php, .asp, etc. (both upper case and lower case) to this controller.</p><pre><code class="code">route_in=(
 ('.*.(php|PHP|asp|ASP|jsp|JSP)','jammer/default/jam'),
)</code></pre><p>The first time you are attacked you may incur a small overhead, but our experience is that the same attacker will not try twice.</p>
